## Customer Segmentation For A Subscrption Service: Illuminating Customer Behaviour

### Project Overview
I embarked on a mission to dissect customer data for a subscription service, aiming to identify segments and trends that would revolutionize the company's understanding of its customers in general and also by the regions. The objective of this project is to analyze customer data for subscription services. The scope of the project includes analyzing customer data, identifying subscription patterns, discovering trends in cancellations and renewals. This project aims to provide comprehensive analysis of customer data to inform data-driven decisions.

### Data Sources
The data used was a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet(Customer Data for a Subscription Service) provided by the Incubator Hub.

### Tools Used
Based on my previous learning while taking the Data Analysis course with the Incubator Hub, I made use of the following tool which are;
* MicrosoftExcel:Used in calculating the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription type. Also used in the analysis of customer data using pivot tables to summarize and analyze subscription trends in various regions.
* SQL:The primary function of SQL in this project was data retieval. I utilized SELECT statements to extract specific data points, such as; top 5 customers, most popular subscription type and so on.
* Power BI:Used to create a data model that defines relationships between different data entities, also to create interactive dashboards, reports and charts to visualize data insights. The DAX formulas were also used in calculating metrics, creating measures and defining calculations.

  ### Data Cleaning and Inspection
  I prepared the data for analysis by;
  *  Loading it
  *  Handling missing values,
  *  Removing duplicates and Null Values in order to avoid inadecuacies and skewed results or findings.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
This part basically highlights some of the questions this project aims to answer, such as;
* Total number of customers from each region
* Most popular subscription type
* Customers that canceled their subscriptions within 6 months
* Top 5 Customers
* Bottom 5 Customers

  ### Data Analysis and Visualizations
  My Analysis includes the techniques used in achieving these insights as I aimed at achieving the following;
 * Visualized and explored the dataset using Power BI as my visualization tool, which helped to create interactive dashboards and charts
 * Performed statistical analysis and created Pivot tables to show trends and patterns using MicrosoftExcel
 * Employed SQL to query and manipulate data to get certain insights such as;
 - Top 5 Customers
 - Bottom 5 Customers
 - Most popular subscription type
 - Most popular subscription type based on each region
 - Total number of customers from each region.

### Findings
While carrying out the analysis, I made some of the findings below;
* The East has the highest number of customers with 8,488 customers
* The West has the lowest number of customers with 8,420 customers
* The most popular subscription type by the number of customers is the Basic type
* No customer canceled their subscription within 6 months
* Cus1302 has the highest purchases with 23,070 as total purchases
* Cus1302, Cus1431, Cus1005, Cus115, Cus1249 are the top 5 customers
* Cus1029 has the lowest purchases with 14,350 as total purchases
* Cus1268, Cus1383, Cus1159, Cus1235, Cus1029 are the bottom 5 customers
* The people in the East and North buys only Basic data
* The people in the South buys only Premium data
* The people in the West buys only Standard data

### Recommendations
Based on my findings, I assume; 
* Basic data is cheaper, hence the reason for its high sales and since it is only bought by those in the East and North, the organization can focus on selling basic data only in these regions and channel marketing strategies to raise awareness about the Basic data subscription type in other regions
* There is a high possibility that people in the Sount and West run business that require bulk data and the Basic data plan is not benefitial to them. A review in the benefits or advantages in terms of usage of the Basic data can make people in the South and West start buying more of Basic data.
* The organization should also try to give out incentives to their top 5 customers either monthly or yearly as a form of motivation and acknowledgement.

### Conclusions
In conclusion, this project has demonstrated the power of data analysis in uncovering valuable insight from customer data. The findings of this project have important implications for business growth and customer retention strategies. By leveraging these insights, businesses can optimize their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth.
