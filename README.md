## Customer Segmentation For A Subscrption Service: Illuminating Customer Behaviour

### Project Overview
I embarked on a mission to dissect customer data for a subscription service, aiming to identify segments and trends that would revolutionize the company's understanding of its customers in general and also by the regions. The objective of this project is to analyze customer data for subscription services. The scope of the project includes analyzing customer data, identifying subscription patterns, discovering trends in cancellations and renewals. This project aims to provide comprehensive analysis of customer data to inform data-driven decisions.

### Data Sources
The data used was a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet(Customer Data for a Subscription Service) provided by the Incubator Hub.

### Tools Used
Based on my previous learning while taking the Data Analysis course with the Incubator Hub, I made use of the following tool which are;
* MicrosoftExcel:Used in calculating the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription type. Also used in the analysis of customer data using pivot tables to summarize and analyze subscription trends in various regions.
* SQL:The primary function of SQL in this project was data retieval. I utilized SELECT statements to extract specific data points, such as; top 5 customers, most popular subscription type and so on.
* Power BI:Used to create a data model that defines relationships between different data entities, also to create interactive dashboards, reports and charts to visualize data insights. The DAX formulas were also used in calculating metrics, creating measures and defining calculations.

  ### Data Cleaning and Inspection
  I prepared the data for analysis by;
  *  Loading it
  *  Handling missing values,
  *  Removing duplicates and Null Values in order to avoid inadecuacies and skewed results or findings.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
This part basically highlights some of the questions this project aims to answer, such as;
* Total number of customers from each region
* Most popular subscription type
* Customers that canceled their subscriptions within 6 months
* Top 5 Customers
* Bottom 5 Customers

  ### Data Analysis and Visualizations
  My Analysis includes the techniques used in achieving these insights as I aimed at achieving the following;
 * Visualized and explored the dataset using Power BI as my visualization tool, which helped to create interactive dashboards and charts
 * Performed statistical analysis and created Pivot tables to show trends and patterns using MicrosoftExcel
 * Employed SQL to query and manipulate data to get certain insights such as;
 - Top 5 Customers
 - Bottom 5 Customers
 - Most popular subscription type
 - Total number of customers from each region.
